##Eight employees at a small company were asked to choose 3 movies that they would most enjoy watching for the upcoming company movie night. These choices are stored in the file Employee_Movie_Choices.txt.

#A second file, Employee_Relationships.txt, has data on the relationships between different coworkers.

#The relationship score has value of -100 (Enemies) to +100 (Best Friends). A value of zero means the two employees haven't interacted or are indifferent.

#Both files are tab delimited.
